Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Overview of the Analysis
* The purpose of the analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of a data model and predict the credit worthiness of potential borrowers from a peer-to-peer lending services
* I used LogisticRegression, the confusion_matrix, and classification_report on the data to locate the accuracy of the test data

## Results
Describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 95%, when we take into account the recall and/or the true positive rate(sensitivity) AND the true negative rate(specificity) of the model we got 95% accuracy
* Precision Score: 92% of the predicited positives were accurate in the data
* Recall Score: 95% of the data was accurate in prediciting true positive values from all the positive predictions that were made. 

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any.

* I would recommend using the model to assist in predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers. The model had 95% accuracy in prediciting the repayment of the intiial loan back to the company. The company can use this model and change it to fit different lines of buisness to insure that there will be sufficent cash flow for both the lenders and to make sure the buisness is profitable.
